# Cross browser support
In order to keep development simple and fast we've decided to offer support at two levels "Fully Supported" and "Basic Support".

As a tool for building Government websites, UI-Kit aims to offer support for all users, regardless of the technology they use. However not all browsers are equal so the experience will need to vary depending on device and software.


## Fully supported
Browsers in this category receive the closest to desired experience.

* All, or nearly all, of the design features prescribed in the design docs
* Advanced functionality and behaviour

### Browsers:
Fully supported browsers are known, capable, modern, and common. Support for these browsers takes full advantages of modern web standards to supply a modern web experience.



## Basic support
This will most likely be a "fallback". The simplest layout that will work in most graphical browsers.

For browsers in this category:
* Pages are given a basic design and layout
* All pages look and largely behave the same
* Functionality for critical task completion is present
* Content is accessible
* JavaScript is not required

### Browsers:
Most browsers not in the "fully supported" categories, within reason.
