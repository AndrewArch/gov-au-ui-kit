# Cross browser support
We aim for GOV.AU UI-Kit to support the browsers and devices of all users.

We defined these levels initially using Australia.gov.au analytics.

This table will be revised when needed to better meet user needs.

There are other browsers with full support.

## Full support
The closest to intended experience:
* all (or most) features documented in GOV.AU UI-Kit
* advanced functionality and behaviour.

## Basic support
Usually a fallback, using the simplest layout available to most graphical browsers:
* accessible content
* functionality to complete critical user tasks
* basic page design and layout
* similar look and behaviour across all pages
* JavaScript not required.
