<h2>Article title</h2>
<p class="abstract">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</p>
<p>Vertical rhythm should be <strong>maintained</strong> between content elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an unsorted list item</li>
  <li>another unsorted list item</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorted list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>first sorted list item</li>
  <li>second sorted list item
    <ol>
      <li>another item</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>and another item</li>
</ol>

<h3>Inner article heading, 3</h3>

<p>As well as definition lists:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Definition term 1</dt>
  <dd>Definition description</dd>
  <dd>A single definition term can have many definitions.</dd>

  <dt>Second definition term</dt>
  <dd>Another definition.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These interespersed elements aim to show the <em>vertical rhythm</em> between
   various content elements, using predominately margin-bottom, and only
   margin-top in the instances where it would be too cumbersome or hacky to try
   continue with just margin-bottom.</p>

<p class="callout">This is a callout.</p>

<p class="callout warning-block">This is a warning callout.</p>

<p>This makes maintaining the vertical rhythm between content easier, and avoids
   spacing bugs, as well as sizing bugs that aren't immediately apparent when
   just testing with a few paragraphs and headings.</p>
