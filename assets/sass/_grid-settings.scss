Grid

This framework uses [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) and [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) to create a consistent 16 column responsive grid layout with good defaults.

Avoid mixing this layout with other grid layouts.

The grid unit proportions, gutters and spacing are defined in `_grid-settings.scss`.

If you need to reference just the grid, not the whole framework, use:

```
@import "grid-settings"
```

Extending grid settings

**REWRITE THIS**

If you need a new element [log a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues) so we can include it for everyone. <!-- fix anchor link once readme is approved -->

For each new element you will need to manually set column properties, starting from the smallest breakpoint. <!-- is this correct? -->

Debugging

Turn on the visual grid to help debugging:

```
$visual-grid: true;
```

/*
Spacing

Maximum page width is set to 16 columns centred, 1200px. Gutters between the columns are a minimum of 20px.

Properties are sized in ems to allow elements to cascade properly

```
$grid-columns: 12 !global;
$max-width: em(1200) !global;
$gutter: em(20);
```

The grid element column properties for block level elements (`header`, `footer`, `main`, `article`) are defined in `_block-elements.scss`.

There is a wrapper class for escaping the outer (grid) container: `<div class="wrapper">`. This is reserved for the page header.

/*
Breakpoints

This framework uses 4 breakpoints for grid layout:

- Mobile: 4 columns, 420px maximum
- Tablet: 8 columns, 768px maximum
- Desktop: 12 columns, 1000px maximum
- Wide desktop: 16 columns, 1200px maximum

Make sure you think about the number of columns used when resizing for small devices (eg see the [Bourbon Neat documentation](http://neat.bourbon.io/)). **IMPROVE THIS**

These are different from the [typography breakpoints](section-typography.html#kssref-typography-2-headings-body-copy).

```
@import 'vendor/neat/neat-helpers';
$desktop: new-breakpoint(max-width 1000px 12);
$tablet: new-breakpoint(max-width 768px 8);
$mobile: new-breakpoint(max-width 420px 4);
```

/*
Accessibility

Design for small screens first. Optimise for larger sizes, but do not assume you know which devices people are using.

Long lines reduce legibility. Lines of text should be no longer than 75 characters. Place text in narrower grid boxes to stop text lines from becoming too wide.

Low-vision users should be able to increase the size of the text by up to 200 per cent without breaking the layout.
